## Main point: Down time is as important as focus for learning
## Details
#focused-mode: is easy for familiar info, thought patterns
					can be painful for new, unkown ideas

when dealing with latter, they need to travel broadly in the brain 

Brain only works in one mode at a time. 
Switching between the 2 helps us understand stuff

>Why sleeping or stepping away from work allows us to understand or solve a problem

#diffused-mode is about letting brain wander, not really thinking about a sepcific thing 
>Dali & Edison would let their brains wander to the verge of sleep
>Then, focus on whatever ideas they had. 

occurs during walks, showers, meals, sleep

Point is:  To come up with something new, 
			don't focus intensely on coming up with something new. 
			Keep that thought in the background, let brain wander 

- [ ] Schedule down time more often. Maybe use cold turkey's locker(?)
- [ ] Or just the stop working alarm @8 PM-ish

Brain is still working when body is at rest. New synapses are formed which enhance what you learned, or form new ideas
