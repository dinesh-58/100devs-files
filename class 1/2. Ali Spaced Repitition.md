## Main point: Try to remember stuff at intervals

## Details
just studying will put stuff in brain
but to remember it long term, you have to recall it at spaced intervals

increase space between intervals to allow ourselves to forget. 
more effort to recall something = more stronger it gets ingrained in memory

Study something. recall it soon after (like an hour or 2 later)
take notes at end of pomodoro session & compare?

- [ ] Format & refine this later. Questions, main takeaway 
- [ ] recall info after studying. try not to make notes currently (lmao. ironic)

	- answers to questions
	- or, a certain topic
- [ ] don't take notes yet, just understand
- [ ] recall & make notes
- [ ] reference to see if anything missed
- [ ] schedule another recall few hours later (write down question/ title in desc. for task)
