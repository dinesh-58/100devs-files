## Main point: Work through the struggle, get equivalent rest & down-time
## Details:

When facing something you don't want to do, your brain evokes a negative, painful feeling
To avoid that feeling, we turn to `temporary pleasures` 

However, 
Best way to avoid that pain? `Start work. Trudge through the pain. It'll go away soon`

Reward yourself @ end of pomodoro sessions.

If a concept is vague/ doesn't make sense, `practice it at intervals`
Doing so strengthens the neural thought patterns for that concept

Remember to `take breaks` to allow diffused mode to digest the new concepts

#### Working(Current) Memory     vs     Long-term Memory

Working memory is like RAM. 
Very few things can be stored there at a time (like, 4-ish)
&, they will fade out as new info/ external stimuli replaces them

To effectively transfer info to long term memory   (& ensure we remember it)
use #spaced-repitition 

the 1st few repitions are spaced closer to build familiarity in memory
each repition strengthens/refreshes it so we can remember it longer

While awake, brain produces toxins
**Sleep**: 
- clears them out
- removes un-important memories
- while strenghtening important stuff you were trying to learn

> [!NOTE] Get enough sleep
> Working with inadequate sleep (or a streak of multiple inadequate sleep days)
> makes it harder to focus & remember

Lay foundation with #focused-mode, let it strengthen with #diffused-mode
- [ ] If you try studying a difficult concept right before nap or sleep
      &, tell yourself you want to dream about it
- ~~You will dream about it & understand it better~
- Good advice but I'd rather dream about something else

#### Dr. Terrence Sejnowski's advice 
Learn by :
- doing
>Projects, internships, practice 
>rather than just memorizing theory

- Actively engaging
> Asking questions
> relating to other concepts 

Ideas come when you're passive. Not when you're actively focused on thinking about them

Exercising creates new neurons, ideas

Passion & Persistence = success
> [!NOTE] Finish 100Devs class to the end

Surrounding yourself with creative, inspiring people boosts those same traits in you
> [!NOTE] Don't work in a vaccum

**Exam tip**: If stuck on a question, move onto something else
Chances are, you'll remember the answer later on
